I’m a **junior full-stack web developer** experienced in **Next.js, Svelte, React, Node.js, Express, Supabase, Strapi, PostgreSQL, and MySQL**. I love building **scalable, real-time applications** with a strong focus on performance.

I’m also a **Minecraft plugin developer** working with **Spigot, Paper, BungeeCord, and NMS** to create custom gameplay features.

On mobile, I build apps using **React Native Expo**, including camera integration, Google Maps, offline storage, and API-driven features.

I’m passionate about solving problems, learning quickly, and building polished user experiences.  
**Let’s create something awesome together! 🚀**
